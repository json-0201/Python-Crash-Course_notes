Reviewing the Project

When you’re beginning a new phase of development on a large project,
it’s always a good idea to revisit your plan and clarify what you want to accomplish with the code you’re about to write.

•
Examine our code and determine if we need to refactor before implementing new features.
•
Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen with appropriate spacing around it.
•
Use the spacing around the first alien and the overall screen size to determine how many aliens can fit on the screen.
We’ll write a loop to create aliens to fill the upper portion of the screen.
•
Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground.
If the entire fleet is shot down, we’ll create a new fleet.
If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we’ll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.
•
Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the player has used up the allotted number of ships.
