# styling functions

# Functions should have descriptive names, and these names should uselowercase letters and underscores
# Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what the function does using docstring '''...'''

# If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used on either side of the equal sign
# ex.
# def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value')
# function_name(value_0, parameter_1='value')

# PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ ) recommends that you limit lines of code to 79 characters \
# so every line is visible in a reasonably sized editor window

# ex.
# def function_name(
#       parameter_0, parameter_1, parameter_2,
#       parameter_3, parameter_4, parameter_5):
#   function body...

# All import statements should be written at the beginning of a file
# The only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to describe the overall program
